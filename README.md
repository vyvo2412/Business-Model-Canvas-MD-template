      <b><a href="Key_Partners.md">Key Partners</a></b>
      <p align="justify">- Cloud email provider: We will provide Microsoft Office 365 Premium to our employees, which, will enable our team to send, receive, accept and store email from customers and/or end users. We feel that using one service provider over two will cut down on issues with systems attempting to communicate with each other.<br><br>
      - Banks: Banks will provide us with the money needed to get our company up and running and manage our finances as we grow. Initially, we will apply for a 2,000,000 dollar SBA 7(a) loan from "Chase" bank to get our company started. Additionally, we will use "Capital One" for our business savings, checking and credit card accounts. Capital One offers unlimited transactions with no fees, which could save us money as we continue to grow. Merchant services accounts allow us to accept credit and debit card transactions from our customers. As our Merchant service account provider we will use Flagship Merchant Services. We also work with banks to provide loans to our customers if needed.<br><br>
      - Advertising: Advertising will allow us to get our name and product out in the business world, where we can attract the clients to produce revenue and expanded our business and services. We will advertise through Google Advertising, we have decided on the world largest marketing group Pentagram for our digital design needs and Clay Communications and Marketing for our advertising agency. We feel these key partners will help get our business the publicity it needs to grow.<br><br>
      - Data storage partners: Innovieren requires storage systems that are highly scalable, offer unlimited connectivity, and support multiple platforms. Additionally, we will be handling sensitive information and feel that owning our equipment is preferred over outsourcing our data storage needs.<br><br>
      - IT remote support providers: We will outsource our afterhours technical support services to Flatworld Solutions. This will allow us to provide 24/7 support for our clients.</p>

      <p align="justify">- With our Digital Training Record, not only are we providing a multilinguistic tool to track, document, and ensure an employee’s responsibilities, training, and certifications.<br><br>
        - We are also providing your HR department with a root cause analysis tool to determine why a workplace incident might have occurred to prevent future injuries and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) violations.<br><br>
        - With our product you will be able to see if an employee has been trained on important tasks such as hazardous waste disposal or proper lifting methods for heavy objects.

      <b><a href="Customer_Relationships.md">Customer Relationships</a></b>
      <p align="justify"> - Innovieren believes current clients will be just as important as new buyers. As such; our Sales Representatives will work to develop lasting relationships with our customers, while attracting new customers. New customers will contact or be contacted by a Sales Representative through one of the listed Channels. During this contact we would customize a training record. Specific account information, training video and download link for the software would be emailed after the contact.<br><br>
        - After subscription purchase, and depending on the needs of the business, we would send a team of professionals to the client. This team would provide in depth training to employees on the software use and provide consultation on OSHA requirements and other standard business practices.<br><br>
        - For current customers we plan on maintaining these lasting relationships; at a minimum Sales Representatives keep quarterly contact with our client’s Human Resource Department and/or designated Manager to illicit feedback and ensure the product is working as promised.<br><br>
        - Our plan is to use our clients preferred method of contact. Whether it be via a phone call, text message, e-mail, video and/or online chat. The means we would provide services to our customers would be; personal assistances in the form training and technical support, for self and automated services our website would include a customer login, under the clients account would be a customized "support" section to aid with fixes and include company specific training tutorials.<br><br>
        - All of these efforts will assist in maintaining a lasting relationship and make it easier to upsell product advancements. We expect our clients will react favorably, by using their preferred method of contact to regularly check in with them. This gesture would show that we care about their business and how our product is integrating and adding value to their organization.</p>

      <b><a href="Financial_Plan.md">Cost Structure</a></b>
      <p align="justify">
        - To establish the business, Innovieren spends a lot of investment on perfecting our Digital Training Record before it is officially launched and introduced to customers. Then, we spend on marketing and advertising, recruiting and training new sales representatives.<br><br>
        - To keep the business running, we continue to spend on marketing and advertising, rent and utilities, employees' salaries. For future competitiveness and ability to achieve long-term profit, Innovieren will cut down overhead costs that incur in rent, utilities. Since our key activities of our business (digital product and services) occur mostly on an on-line platform, we would no longer request our employees to be at the office. Thus, we will rent a smaller office, paying less in rent.<br><br>
        - Meanwhile, once we have gained enough revenue, we would proceed to develop our training program, hiring employees to become professional trainers.<br><br>
        - The most expensive key resources are technical expertise (Digital Training Record and customed training programs), employees with certain skill sets (sales representatives, technicians, professional trainers).<br><br>
        - The most expensive key activities include building and maintain the application, marketing and advertising, assessment development.</p>
