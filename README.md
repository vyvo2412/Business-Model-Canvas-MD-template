      <p>With our Digital Training Record, not only are we providing a multilinguistic tool to track, document, and ensure an employee’s responsibilities, training, and certifications.

      <p align="justify">Innovieren believes current clients will be just as important as new buyers. As such; our Sales Representatives will work to develop lasting relationships with our customers, while attracting new customers. New customers will contact or be contacted by a Sales Representative through one of the listed Channels. During this contact we would customize a training record. Specific account information, training video and download link for the software would be emailed after the contact. After subscription purchase, and depending on the needs of the business, we would send a team of professionals to the client. This team would provide in depth training to employees on the software use and provide consultation on OSHA requirements and other standard business practices. For current customers we plan on maintaining these lasting relationships; at a minimum Sales Representatives keep quarterly contact with our client’s Human Resource Department and/or designated Manager to illicit feedback and ensure the product is working as promised. Our plan is to use our clients preferred method of contact. Whether it be via a phone call, text message, e-mail, video and/or online chat. The means we would provide services to our customers would be; personal assistances in the form training and technical support, for self and automated services our website would include a customer login, under the clients account would be a customized "support" section to aid with fixes and include company specific training tutorials. All of these efforts will assist in maintaining a lasting relationship and make it easier to upsell product advancements. We expect our clients will react favorably, by using their preferred method of contact to regularly check in with them. This gesture would show that we care about their business and how our product is integrating and adding value to their organization</p>

      <p align="justify">We will utilize Sales Representatives to manage new and current customer contact. We plan on using the following platforms to attract new customers. Social Media sites such as: "Facebook", "Twitter", "You Tube", "Instagram", "Tumblr" and "Linked In". We feel Web Advertising through Google could aid in attaching clients, initially we would limit our clicks to 50 a day and evaluating if more or less is beneficial. Considering, managers that might not be as tech savvy, we plan to use the old tried and true methods; phone calls, e-mails, our website and face-to-face contacts. We plan to peak our client's interest in our product by allowing them to use and evaluate our basic customizable program free for 120 days. Afterwards, we will have several purchase options to include; an annual, 2 years or 3 years subscriptions for our training record software. Subscription purchases, will be through our website or over the phone. Cost will be based on the clients number of employees and years subscribed. Support will be provided via our website, phone calls, on-line chat/video and in person if needed. All subscriptions include root, cause analysis training, and consulting on preventing OSHA mishaps</p>
